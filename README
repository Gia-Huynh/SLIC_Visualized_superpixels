README

To run project:

slic.py Lenna.png 1000 40

Where:
 arg[1] is the name of the image you would like to run the program on. I have provided Lenna.png in the folder already, but the algorithm should run on any aspect ratio and image.

 arg[2] is the number of pixels you would like the program to create. Different (less impressive) results occur when you reduce the number of pixels you want. And likewise, when you request a higher pixel total, 10,000 for example, the results are great, but the runtime is not.

 	recommended: 100 and 1000

 arg[3] is SLIC_m which is described in the paper as the the control in compactness of a superpixel. They use 10, but I found that tuning this parameter was most key in finding the best (most accurate) superpixels.

 	recommended (for Lenna.png) 40
